oops is a part of procedural programming.If we have to reuse a certain task then we make a function for it...so oops brings reusability in our code

we need reusability-->go for functions

oops consists of classes and objects and it is optional to use them....but there a definitely a lot of problems that can be easily and quickly solved using classes and objects


oops is basically mappin real word problems with code
eg mouse is an onject, pen is and object
IRL everything around us is an object and when we want to simulate these things in a code format oops comes into play


json response is a great example of object orientation
student{
    name,
    class,
    roll no...etcetcetc
}




CLASS- a class is a blueprint of an object
jaise factory pehle se define krdeti hai ki uske products kaise dikhenge ussi tarah se a class defines how its objects are gonna be

OBJECT-an object is an instance of a class
wo blueprint ke according jo cheez humne design ki hai that is object

eg 

class student:
    name,score,cgpa

Example of this is given in classes&ibjects.py file
